= ADR: Kobol vs Pegasus
Sebastian Sommerfeld <sebastian@sommerfeld.io>

The decision at hand is whether to run all development tools directly on my local workstation (kobol) or inside a Vagrantbox (pegasus). This ARD only affects "normal" development workstations. The Virtualization solution of choice is Virtualbox with Vagrant.  My dedicated VM server is running Proxmox.

NOTE: Status = Done (2022-05-16)

IMPORTANT: Update (2022-07-13) -> Decision withdrawn and turned in favor of kobol (see "Decision")

== Requirements Overview
. Setup with minimal manual interactions and minimal development tools installed directly onto my workstation.
. Encapsulated as much as possible inside Docker Containers and/or Vagrantboxes to ensure (broken) updates can easily be rolled back and the setup is portable in case I have to reset my workstation or have to switch to another workstation.
.. Add or update packages without any risk -> avoid having to repair broken installations (dumping the broken setup and reverting to a working one is preferred).
.. Instead of using `apt-get install` use Docker and create a Symlink in `/usr/bin` to a wrapper-script which delegates commands to a Docker contaner.
. Use the same setup for the workstation I use at work (as far as possible -> Windows vs Linux -> at least ssh keys won't be not the same!)

=== Quality Goals
. The whole setup is Infrastructure as Code.
. Run as much as possible in Containers.

== Decision
The setup of choice uses a Vagrantbox for all development tools. This The main reasons are the simple setup and the clearly defined baseline which allows to easily revert to a working setup in case the setup gets messy.

=== Decision Update
Update (2022-07-13) -> Although the desicion to favor a Vagrantbox makes sence for several reasons, working with this VM Turned out to be rather uncomfortable. When Vagrantboxes are involved, the Vagrantbox is not usable because it cannot handle VMs. For this usecase one has to switch to the host machine. By doing this not all features and tools are available or are not installed the same way / at the same location. Because of this discrepancy the decision is cancelled and turned in favor of working directly on the host machine. This emphasizes the need to run as much as possible in Docker containers and enforces the disciplin to follow infrastructure as code principles.

=== Decision Details
NOTE: These details are part of the original decision which now is invalid.

General takeaways are:

. Every new tool installation should get its own git branch. This way rolling back becomes as easy as possible.
. Run as much as possible in containers! This way separating tools from themselves and repairing broken configs becomes much easier, even when the development tools are not encapsulated in a Vagrantbox.
