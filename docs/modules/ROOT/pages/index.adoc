[IMPORTANT]
====
*Todos*

. Merge and delete repo kobol-config
. ADR: xref:ADRs:architecture-decision-records/kobol-vs-pegasus.adoc[]
. ADR: xref:ADRs:architecture-decision-records/chef-vs-ansible.adoc[]
. Do I really need the separate prometheus-grafana repo? Can I merge the repo into this project? Or is this a service on its own? If so, create a Docker image and deploy via terraform.
.. Can terraform deploy containers to remote raspi nodes? Withoput kubernetes etc?!
. Find Docker-based alternative to cron -> Rundeck or something else?
. Make Vagrantbox idempotent -> handle .gitignore differently
====

== Requirements Overview
. Centrally manage all my infrastructure components.
.. My physical workstations and all link:/playgrounds-docs/main[non-playground] Vagrantboxes
.. My homelab (physical and virtual)
.. My public website (classic web hosting and link:https://cloud.digitalocean.com[DigitalOcean])
. Every single setup for every component with as little manual interaction as possible.
. Manage assets which are common to all projects in one place.
.. Allow other projects, to load these assets into their respective repo (each project takes care of this on its own)

== Quality Goals
. Lint everything inside this repo
. Encapsulate as much as possible inside Docker Containers and/or Vagrantboxes to ensure (broken) updates can easily be rolled back and the setup is portable in case I have to reset my workstation or have to switch to another workstation.
.. Add or update packages without any risk -> avoid having to repair broken installations (dumping the broken setup and reverting to a working one is preferred).
.. Instead of using e.g. `apt-get install`, use Docker Contaioners and create a Symlink in `/usr/bin` to a wrapper-script which delegates commands to a Docker contaner.

=== Technologies used in this project
The following technologies are the big building blocks of this project. Other technologies and helpers like several linters although being useful and essential as well don't qualify as building block technology and are not listed here.

=== Public Sites hosted on the Internet
Public sites are divided into two parts. One half is hosted traditionally by a classic hosting provider and the other half is hosted in the cloud (see xref:ADRs:architecture-decision-records/cloud-provider.adoc[]).

For information on the cloud setup take a look at the "xref:cloud/index.adoc[]" page.

=== On-Premise Homelab

== Usage
=== Guidelines and Conventions
See xref:GUIDELINES:index.adoc[]

=== Linters
The link:https://github.com/sebastian-sommerfeld-io/infrastructure[Infrastructure Repository] contains ready-to-use linter definitions which other projects can download and use (see link:https://github.com/sebastian-sommerfeld-io/infrastructure/blob/main/lint.sh[lint.sh]).

==== directory-validator
The link:https://github.com/goerwin/directory-validator[directory-validator] checks if all mandatory files and folders are present. Folders cannot be empty. For "empty" folders, add a .gitkeep file and explain why this folder is empty (= empty in the remote repo).

A possible usecase might be that a directory is "empty" but contains ignored files (like some sort of secret) on the developer machine.

Empty .gitkeep files normally are placeholders, until the directory is populated with the actual content.
