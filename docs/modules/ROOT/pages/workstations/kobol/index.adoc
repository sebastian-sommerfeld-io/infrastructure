Setup, configuration and documentation for my local Ubuntu workstation following an infrastructure as code approach.

== Requirements Overview
. Setup my local workstation with minimal manual interactions.
. Add or update packages without any risk -> avoid having to repair broken installations (dumping the broken setup and reverting to a working one is preferred).
. Test the setup regularly (automated) to ensure a new installation from scratch will work.

== Quality Goals
. The whole setup of my local workstation, all my Vagrantboxes and all my Docker images is Infrastructure as Code.
. Software installations through the classic package managers like `apt` should be avoided. As much as possible should run inside docker containers. This is true for the host machine as well as Vagrantboxes.

== Building Block View / Whitebox Overall System
=== Services
The following services are up and running when the machine is started.

== Install
Download and install a fresh link:https://ubuntu.com[Ubuntu] from an iso image:

. Download iso image from https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop
. Create bootable USB stick using the application "Startup Disk Creator" (shipped with Ubuntu) or some other software like https://www.balena.io/etcher[Etcher]
. Install the OS on the machine

Once the basic OS is installed, perform the following steps on your machine:

. Choose NVIDIA graphics driver from "Additional Drivers"
. Enable Dark Mode
. Setup three monitors, Dock position and icon size, add favourite applications to Dock
. Login to Firefox Sync
. Adjust wokspaces behavior in _Settings > Multitasking_ (Workspaces on all displays)
. Setup Deja Dup Backups for folder "/media/sebastian/USB-1TB/.kobol-backups/deja-dup
. Run setup from infrastructure repository
.. Install git using `sudo apt-get install -y git` and create folder `mkdir -p ~/work/repos/sebastian-sommerfeld-io`
.. Clone repository (`git clone https://github.com/sebastian-sommerfeld-io/infrastructure.git`) to `~/work/repos/sebastian-sommerfeld-io`
... Run `src/main/workstations/kobol/provision/10-configure.sh` -> Basic configuration and .bashrc settings
... Run `src/main/workstations/kobol/provision/20-install.sh` -> Install software packages
... Run `src/main/workstations/kobol/provision/21-install-intellij.sh` -> Install IntelliJ
... Run `src/main/workstations/kobol/provision/90-start-services.sh` -> Start basic services and docker containers which are always running
.. Add `~/work`, `~/temp` and `~/virtualmachines` to favourites (in File Manager)
.. Update file associations in Settings > Applications > Sublime Text
.. Clone repositories
. Enable Auto-Export for Firefox bookmarks
. Open `about:config`
.. Set `browser.bookmarks.autoExportHTML = true`
.. Set `browser.bookmarks.file = "/home/sebastian/work/repos/sebastian-sommerfeld-io/website-sommerfeld-io/subdomain-www/src/main/firefox-bookmarks.html"` -> Since this folder is part of the repository link:https://github.com/sebastian-sommerfeld-io/website-sommerfeld-io[website-sommerfeld-io] it is important to clone the all repositories first (as stated above).
. Import existing Virtualbox VMs

=== Steam Setup for Windows Games on Linux
. Install Steam
. Enable the Steam Beta Client: Go to _Steam -> Settings_ and (in the account tab) click change in the Steam Beta Update and click on Steam Beta Update
. Enable Steam Play for all games: Go to _Settings -> Steam Play Tab_ and click "Enable Steam Play for all titles"
